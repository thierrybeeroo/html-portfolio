 <hr />

 <h3>Man on Fire</h3>

 <p>This movie from Denzel Washington is an excellent thriller and action movies as well where we can see a little girl being kidnapped.<br />
    It all started with all debts that his parents specially her father who inherited from his grandparents.<br />
    I recommend this film as it touches our soul how far we can go for money.</p>

    <h3>Sound of Freedom</h3>

    <p>This movie is about human trafficking.<br />
        A true story based on child trafficking specially small child from tender age.<br />
        It almost 2 hours to watch but this also touches our soul how we humans can treat child and how sex pedophile exist.<br />
        </p>

        <h3>American Gangster</h3>

        <p>This movie is based on the rude,nastiest and clever guy named Frank Lucas.<br />
           In Harlem where Frank Lucas was raised and how he become the greatest Drug Dealer from 1980-1998.<br />
