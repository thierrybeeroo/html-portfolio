<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Thierry Beeroo and i'm 37 years old, married to a lovely and beautiful wife named Jane Beeroo with a 
  little darling and our princess of just 7 years old named Iris Beverly Jade Beeroo. Since 2015 my wife and I met 
 where we start exchanging through hours without paying attention to the clock telling stories and everything.
 We were passionate of each other and on 17th July 2016, we decided to get married and that was the beginning 
 of our tendorly life.</p>

<p>We were living our best life and at that time i was riding motorcycles haojue 125cc and then i changed.</p>
  I bought a Kawasaki 125 KLX model where it was the beginning of new life where i grew from adolescent to 
  a man where i started to learn more taking small jobs after office and sometimes between as i grind
  this mentality of multitasking.
  I took the notary project of whole infrastruce and on the other side i already left Crains Technologies where i
  started as an IT Support Offices.
  MY daily job was fixing hardware and software issues where interventions to customers , banks , offices and spa 
  was on planning. I learned from the root and this helped me a lot in the future . Another mentality which i grew
  was observe ,be silent and patient , talk only when it should , listen carefully then build your strategy.

<p>IN 2017 - 2018 , it was like lightning as i started to dream bigger and i continued to learn and my passions
  beyond assembling or disassembling computers, laptops , printers and servers sometimes, was setting up and 
  configuring servers to put on live. That's how i continued my career , i went through many difficulties where
  i learn a lot from my mistakes and take risk proposing to IT Administrator of MSCL at that time where 2 big 
  hospital named Clinique Darne and Wellkin Hospital and small clinique named Fortis Nord Darne.
  I took the active directory project where i build the server on the new Hypervisor newly bought
  and i configured the active directory where all hospitals synced simultaneously. I becamed known where i was 
  in charge of team where i formed new joiners under the supervision of Master Sunil Kayala where i grew a lot 
  where security , network , bash scripting , firewalls and we application firewall and many other things 
  like an IT should know and aware. I learned how to make projects and design a network. we launched the 
  new clinic in Tamarin where i learned loadbalancing and VPN between sites , how they were interconnected
